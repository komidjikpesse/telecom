Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. Huffman encoding uses a variable-length code to represent a symbol from the source (for example a character in a file). The code is determined from an estimate of the probabilities of appearance of the source symbols, a short code being associated with the most frequent source symbols.

A Huffman code is optimal in the sense of the shortest length for symbol coding, and a known probability distribution. More complex methods carrying out probabilistic modeling of the source make it possible to obtain better compression ratios.

This project aims to simulate this decoding as well as the decoding associated with it. The tests will be carried out on several types of files such as images or texts.
