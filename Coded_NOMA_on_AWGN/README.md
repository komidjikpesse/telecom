# Coded_NOMA_on_AWGN

This simple work is the result of the effort and thinking of a research team.

This code is based on the paper "Exact BER Performance Analysis of an Elementary Coding Techniques for NOMA System on AWGN Channel"
in:  https://www.radioeng.cz/fulltexts/2024/24_01_0045_0053.pdf and on my academic courses in INSA HDF.
